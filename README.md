Hi, my name is Madison Isfan and I am a self-taught software developer. 

After spending 2 years in college I decided to challenge myself with the self-taught developer route. Over the years, I have enrolled in online courses, graduated from the Nucamp Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, and created an IOS app that launched my startup. I am now on my search for an entry-level position or internship.

I have touched on many subjects but my main focuses are React and SwiftUI. 

At the moment, I am adding new features to my iOS app, TrainrAI. I am also building a very simple [portfolio website](https://github.com/madisonisfan/Portfolio-Website-Simple) to display my education, experience, and skills.

I am very open to collaborating on a variety of projects, but I would like to focus on improving my skills and challenging myself with React and SwiftUI.
